# Pandemia.fi

[Pandemia.fi](https://www.pandemia.fi/) is an information resource and a news aggregator that only an independent team of volunteer individuals could build.

# Contributing

You can contribute to the project by submitting a PR.

## Future

We are looking to ditch the current Bootstrap theme and move to a React based frontend. The work is only beginning now and additional contributors are more than welcome!

## Biggest issues

These are the biggest issues in the current Bootstrap implementation:

- Page load time.
- Cache busting.
- Mobile user experience.
